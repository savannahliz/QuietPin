*Interaction sketch, not an application screenshot.*

You are working on one thing when another idea appears. Switching apps to record it breaks your flow; ignoring it risks losing it. Aside keeps the detour short: **press a shortcut → write one line → return to your work.**

It is a small desktop Inbox, not a wall of separate sticky-note windows. Every thought goes into one list, unpinned by default. Only the three items you choose can stay in sight. Notes stay on your device; no account, cloud sync, or AI service is required.

## Get started

1. Download the installer for your system from [v1.1.0 Releases](https://github.com/savannahliz/aside/releases/tag/v1.1.0). The source archives are not runnable apps.
2. Launch Aside. Press the capture shortcut from any app to bring up the centered input bar.
3. Type and press **Enter**. The bar disappears and the item lands in Inbox. Press **Esc** to cancel. You can change the capture shortcut and submit key in Settings.

| Platform | Download | Default capture shortcut |
| --- | --- | --- |
| macOS 13+ · Apple Silicon / Intel | [Download DMG](https://github.com/savannahliz/aside/releases/download/v1.1.0/Aside-1.1.0-macOS-universal.dmg) | Option + Space |
| Windows 10/11 · x64 | [Download EXE](https://github.com/savannahliz/aside/releases/download/v1.1.0/Aside-1.1.0-Windows-x64.exe) | Ctrl + Alt + Space |

On Mac, open the DMG and drag `Aside.app` into Applications. It lives in the menu bar, not the Dock. On Windows, run `Aside.exe`; no separate .NET installation is needed. You can find it in the system tray.

> The installers are not yet formally code-signed. Gatekeeper may block the first Mac launch, and Windows may show an unknown-publisher warning. Verify the download source first; [Mac-specific steps are below](#macos-blocks-the-first-launch).

## Set the thought aside; keep the important work in view

- **Quick capture:** The centered bar appears on demand and disappears after saving. Its cancel button appears on hover; new items go to the regular Inbox by default.
- **One Inbox, up to three pins:** Expand to review everything or collapse to see just your pins. Pinning a fourth item asks which pin to replace; the replaced item stays in Inbox.
- **Less desktop clutter:** Use the full list, a three-pin view, or a slim strip. Drag, resize, keep the window on top, or tuck it against either screen edge until you move back to reveal it.
- **A quieter appearance:** Pick any background color with the system color picker, save favorites, and separately adjust idle, active, and quick-capture opacity.
- **Tidy up later:** Restore completed items or clear only the completed ones. The first clear asks for confirmation; you can opt out of future prompts.

## First launch and upgrading

### macOS blocks the first launch

The current DMG is not signed with an Apple Developer ID or notarized. If macOS says it cannot verify that Aside is free of malware, this is neither a malware detection nor a safety certification. **Proceed only if you have verified that the file came from this repository's Release and you trust its source.** Follow [Apple's official instructions](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102445):

1. Click **Done**, not **Move to Trash**.
2. Open **System Settings → Privacy & Security**, then scroll down to **Security**.
3. Find Aside's blocked-app notice, click **Open Anyway**, and confirm **Open**.

Changing “Allow applications downloaded from” to “App Store and identified developers” does not replace **Open Anyway** for this unsigned build. You do not need to disable Gatekeeper or run a Terminal command. Removing the first-launch warning requires a future Developer ID–signed, Apple-notarized release.

### Upgrading from QuietPin

Quit the old app before launching Aside. Internal data locations and stable identifiers stay the same to preserve existing notes and settings.

- **Mac:** `Aside.app` does not replace `QuietPin.app` automatically. Once you have checked that your notes appear in Aside, you may remove the old app; do not delete the data directory below.
- **Windows:** The new program is `Aside.exe`. If launch-on-login was enabled, turn it off and back on in Aside's Settings to update the saved EXE path. Mac users should also re-enable launch-on-login after upgrading.

## Data and current limits

| Platform | Local notes |
| --- | --- |
| macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/QuietPin/inbox.json` |
| Windows | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\QuietPin\inbox.json` |

The `QuietPin` directory name remains for compatibility. On Mac, appearance and window settings are stored in UserDefaults; on Windows, settings and notes share the same file. Quit the app before copying a data file for backup. There is no cross-device sync, and Mac and Windows data files cannot be swapped directly.

Automated macOS tests cover the data model, saved colors, window modes, screen-edge behavior, and quick capture. The Windows build has passed cross-compilation and data-model tests, but its UI, global shortcut, multi-monitor behavior, and launch-on-login have **not yet been tested on a physical Windows machine**. Intel Mac, full-screen apps, and multiple desktops have not all been tested individually either.

## Build from source

macOS requires macOS 13+ and Xcode Command Line Tools. The app uses SwiftUI, AppKit, and Carbon, with no third-party code dependencies.

```sh
bash scripts/test-macos.sh
bash scripts/build-macos.sh
```

This produces `dist/Aside.app` and a universal DMG. Windows requires the .NET 10 SDK; the app uses WPF and Win32:

```powershell
dotnet run --project windows/Tests/CoreChecks.csproj -c Release
dotnet publish windows/QuietPin.Windows.csproj -c Release -r win-x64 --self-contained true -o dist/windows-x64
```

On macOS, you can also point `DOTNET_BIN` to the .NET 10 SDK and run `bash scripts/build-windows.sh` to cross-compile the Windows package.
